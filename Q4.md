# Pic-Man Battle
My idea is bring PVP battle into the game. It's more exciting and suitable for modern network environments.Although there were some similar games like Pac-Man Battle Royale, I'd to keep Pic-Man's central idea: route planning. 

## Game Play
The scene of game is twd mirrored maze that separated from middle.

The ghosts will start from center of the maze. If the ghost eat player, a life is lost and will reborn in 3 seconds. Ghosts are getting more and more with time.
At the beginning of the game, multiple dots and a Power Pellet produced in the maze. The Pic-Man becomes bigger when eatting the Power Pellet, and gains ability to eat the ghost.
The ghost will fly to opponent's maze, so it's strategic to eat ghosts in a row.
When all of the dots in maze are eaten, Regenerate dots, the Power Pellet and a random item. You can use items to obstruct your opponent, likes slow speed, temporary obstacle, etc.

## End of Game
Game will end when a player runs out with lifes or times up.
In the case of time, the winner is the one with a high score.
